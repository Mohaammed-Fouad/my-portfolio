# Mohammed Fouad â€” Computational Chemist Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website for Mohammed Fouad, a Computational Chemist specializing in **QSAR**, **cheminformatics**, and **machine learning** for drug discovery. The site showcases skills, projects, and a professional gallery in a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate format.

## Features

  - **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts to fit a variety of screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
  - **Clean and Modern UI:** A dark theme with a professional color palette, built using Tailwind CSS for efficient styling.
  - **Interactive Elements:**
      - A dynamic molecule drawing section that animates different chemical structures.
      - A scroll-based fade-in effect to reveal content as you navigate the page.
      - Accessible, touch-friendly carousels for showcasing projects and gallery images.
  - **Optimized Performance:** Uses `loading="lazy"` for images and asynchronous Google Analytics to ensure fast page load times.
  - **Semantic HTML and Accessibility:** Includes ARIA attributes and a "Skip to content" link for improved accessibility.

## Technologies Used

  - **HTML5:** The core structure of the website.
  - **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling without writing custom CSS.
  - **JavaScript:** Powers the interactive elements, including the mobile menu, molecule drawing, and carousels.
  - **SVG:** Used for the interactive molecule graphics, allowing for scalable and lightweight animations.
